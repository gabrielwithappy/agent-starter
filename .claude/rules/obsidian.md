# Obsidian Agent Rules

1.  **Default Document Location**: When creating new documents in Obsidian, always place them in the `obsidianKMS/0.Inbox` folder unless a specific path or folder is requested by the user.
2.  **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive filenames. if a date is relevant, prepend it in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
3.  **Frontmatter**: Ensure all new documents have valid YAML frontmatter, including at least `created: YYYY-MM-DD` and `tags: []`.
