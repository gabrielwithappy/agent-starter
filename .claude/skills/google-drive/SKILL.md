Check authentication status:

## Read Commands

python scripts/drive.py search "quarterly report"

# Search by title only
python scripts/drive.py search "title:budget"

## Search Query Formats

The search command supports multiple query formats:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Full-text | `"quarterly report"` | Searches file contents and names |
| Title | `"title:budget"` | Searches file names only |
| URL | `https://drive.google.com/...` | Extracts and uses file/folder ID |
| Folder ID | `1ABC123...` | Lists folder contents (25+ char IDs) |
| Native query | `mimeType='application/pdf'` | Pass-through Drive query syntax |

## File ID Format

Google Drive uses long IDs like `1ABC123xyz_-abc123`. Get IDs from:
- `search` results
- `find-folder` results
- `list` results
- Google Drive URLs

## Download Limitations

- Regular files (PDFs, images, etc.) download directly
- Google Docs/Sheets/Slides cannot be downloaded via this tool
- For Google Workspace files, use export or dedicated tools

## Token Management

Tokens stored securely using the system keyring:
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Locker
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet, etc.)

Service name: `google-drive-skill-oauth`

Automatically refreshes expired tokens using Google's cloud function.
